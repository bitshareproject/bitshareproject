Bitshare is an extension of the bitcoin protocol. Its main purpose is to facilitate the exchange of equity or part ownership in a public company in relation to the purchase of products or services from a listed company. The bitshare can be traded on an exchange like other regular equities. Bitshares unlike conventional shares are designed more for early stage companies trying to compete against established businesses with a significant financial advantage. 
 
Bitshare allows companies to  compete by offering equity or part ownership in their company to potential customers in exchange for the purchase of products or services. All transactions made in relation to the purchase of products or services are broadcast on a P2P network.  Generally the value of the bitshare is correlated with sales, so the bitshare of a company making more sales will become more valuable over time.
 
Such a model creates a financial incentive for consumers to purchase products and services from early stage companies as opposed to established ones as they have a higher expected payoff from the capital gain achieved from the bitshare offered by a growing company. Early stage companies can also offer a higher equity stake to new customers as there a fewer customers to share the equity. 

## Introduction

Bitshare has a similar paradigm to bitcoin with a few important differences. Bitshare can be mined like bitcoin, however unlike bitcoin where all the mined bitcoin goes to the miner, only a percentage of the bitshare mined is assigned to the miner. The other bitshare is assigned to the public company account, where the bitshare can then be distributed by the public company to its customers usually in relation to the purchase of products or services. This limits the supply of available bitshare a company can distribute to its customers giving it its value.
    
The other important data currently not maintained by a bitcoin network is the metadata relating to sale of products or services. Such metadata should be accompanied with all transactions made on the bitshare network forming a public record of earnings made by a company. This information is used to derive the value of the traded bitshare as expected from a no arbitrage market, where two identical companies should have the same bitshare value.

## Use Cases


Bitshare is motivated by several use cases that may benefit a potential company consumer relationship - listed as follows.
    
1. Advertising Model - exchange bitshare for interaction with a product i.e photo uploads, blog posts, views accrued, followers accrued.
2. Products and Services - exchange bitshare for the purchase of products or services from a company in return for a financial transaction.
3. Human Resources - bitshare is provided to employees of a company in return for their contributed human capital.
4. Bitshare Portfolio - bitshare from a portfolio of companies is bundled together and sold to consumers, employees, public/private equity to diversify risk and maximize expected capital gain. 
5. Public Equity - bitshare is traded on an exchange allowing a company to raise capital by selling bitshare. 
6. Financial Security - bitshare is made secure and free from interference or reliance on any third party organization encouraging investment in countries with unstable governments.
7. Transparency - All transactions made in relation to the exchange of bitshare for a given interaction with a company are made public and difficult to manufacture. This allows information to be made publically available to the market in order to derive the financial value when traded on an exchange.  


The bitshare protocol aims to fulfill all these use cases and multiple other potential use cases.

## Bitshare Events

Bitshare events are essentially an interaction between a company and a customer. A company may wish to broadcast different events to be stored in a block chain. An example of different bitshare events could include the purchase of products or service, a website sign up, a blog post, a photo upload, a new follower. All bitshare events are provided as public information to allow the market to better decide the current value of the bitshare as events unfold over time. 


Each individual bitshare event is just a collection of bytes that is defined by the company and designed to be read by some third party service. The third party service may for instance aggregate different bitshare events over time and display them as public information. Such public information would be used by the market to value the bitshare.


Each bitshare event must have an associated owner with a given account id. The owner of the bitshare event should ideally not be affiliated with the company, otherwise companies could manufacture bitshare events. One way to increase the integrity of a bitshare event is to have a third party service verify and sign the event using their private key. An example of a third party service could include a web browser or payment application. Another possibility in the case of payments is to use another cryptographic currency like bitcoin, where the event can be linked to the bitcoin transaction. 


Another deterrent to stop companies from creating affiliated bitshare events is to introduce a cost to generating the manufactured event. One possibility is to charge a fee to the company wishing to broadcast an event, where the fee would be represented as a transfer of bitshare to the miner incorporating the event into the block chain. Such a bitshare transfer should be uni-directional meaning a company can never regain bitshare once it has been transferred away. Another possible cost is the distribution of the company’s bitshare to another account in relation to an event. This practice may be common or expected from non-affiliated users who expect a payoff in terms of bitshare for using a service. Such an event would therefore include a point to the bitshare transaction corresponding to the event.


Another way to increase the integrity of a bitshare event is to have a third party service provide bitshare accounts to ideally non-affiliated users, where the account has been signed by the third party’s private key. This could be done by charging a signup fee or background verification of the owner of the account. Bitshare event owners that have not been verified by a third party service may hold less weight or be disregarded and not reported as reliable information. A company may also decide to restrict the distribution of bitshare to verified accounts only to improve company integrity.
